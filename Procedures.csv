Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream,X
Nanoxynol Suppository with Bacterial Culture,"1. The benzalkonium chloride or methylbenzethonium chloride, imidiazolidinyl urea, and diazolidinyl urea are added slowly, while thoroughly stirring, to a suspension of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and microcrystalline cellulose in a sterile normal saline solution (quantity sufficient to make a thick paste) at 35◦C to 37◦C. 2. The pH is slowly lowered to approximately 6.0 to 6.3 with reagent grade lactic acid. (This step binds the antimicrobials to the “cellulose” excipients.) 3. The suspension is stirred for 2 hours and then ascorbic acid that was dissolved in approximately 10 to 15 mL sterile saline is slowly added with gentle stirring. 4. The material is, at this point, a very thick paste. Spermicide (Nonoxynol 9) is now added and thoroughly mixed. After this step, the process is performed at 0◦C to 4◦C. 5. The pH of the mixture is then lowered to 4.3 to 4.5 with reagent-grade lactic acid. 6. Then freshly obtained encapsulated lactobacilli bacteria are added to achieve a final concentration of at least 1 million viable bacteria per suppository. (In as much as the goal is to achieve a final concentration of at least 1 million viable bacteria per suppository, a four- to sixfold excess of bacteria are usually added because some loss of the viability occurs during the various mixing processes. This means that approximately 500 mg of the encapsulated bacteria are usually added.) It is important to mix these organisms not only thoroughly to ensure uniformity but also quickly because moisture adversely affects the viability of the organisms. 7. Rapid and thorough mixing can be done, for example, by spreading the paste in a thin layer on a sterile glass plate and then using a replicator to spread the bacteria evenly over the paste. 8. Magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide are added, with or without lactose. 9. After the materials are thoroughly mixed at 0◦C to 4◦C, they are pressed into a mold and dried in a desiccating jar under vacuum at 0◦C to 4◦C. [Drying at room temperature (25◦C) or at higher temperatures decreases the number of viable bacteria.] 10. The suppositories are then sealed in air- and moistureproof containers until used. During storage they should be protected from moisture and extreme temperatures to ensure the viability of the lactobacilli."
